# Identifying-deforestation-using-AI-Model
The main objective of this to classify the images of healthy forest and deforestation using the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) of deep learning. 

This model emphasizes an existing method that which is designed using the ANN algorithm of deep learning. As the deforestation has a major impact on forest ecosystems and therefore its detection and analysis methods should be improved. Where, the classification of healthy forest and the areas of deforestation is important to recognize for which ANN is used that which can classify the deforestation area and healthy forest area.
